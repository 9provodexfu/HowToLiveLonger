Investronica V8R1 consists of four main modules: PGM, MTM, MGS, and FGP. PGM is a pattern design and grading system that allows users to create and modify patterns in 2D and 3D, using advanced features such as automatic seam allowance, dart manipulation, grading rules, and style libraries. MTM is a made-to-measure system that enables users to customize garments according to individual measurements and preferences, using parametric models and interactive fitting simulations. MGS is a marker making and cutting system that optimizes fabric consumption and cutting quality, using automatic nesting algorithms, interactive editing tools, and integration with Lectra's cutting machines. FGP is a production management system that controls and monitors the entire manufacturing process, from order entry to delivery, using barcode scanning, data exchange, and real-time reporting.
 
Investronica V8R1 is compatible with Windows operating systems and can be integrated with other Lectra solutions such as Modaris, Kaledo, Diamino, Vector, and Formaris. Investronica V8R1 also supports data exchange with other CAD/CAM systems and industry standards such as DXF, AAMA, ASTM, ISO, and Gerber. Investronica V8R1 is a powerful and versatile software suite that can help apparel companies improve their productivity, quality, creativity, and profitability.
