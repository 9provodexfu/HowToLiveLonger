# How to Use Virtual Serial Ports Emulator x64 to Test Serial Devices
 
Virtual serial ports emulator x64 (VSPE) is a software tool that allows you to create and use virtual serial ports on your 64-bit Windows operating system. Virtual serial ports can emulate the behavior and functionality of real serial ports, such as transmitting and receiving data, setting baud rate, parity, flow control, etc. You can use VSPE to create various virtual devices, such as connectors, splitters, pairs, mappers, bridges, and more. You can also connect virtual serial ports to physical serial ports or to network sockets using TCP or UDP protocols.

One of the main advantages of using VSPE is that you can test your serial applications and devices without the need for additional hardware or cables. You can simulate different scenarios and configurations using virtual serial ports and devices. For example, you can test how your application handles data loss, noise, latency, or errors in the serial communication. You can also monitor and analyze the data traffic between virtual serial ports using built-in or external tools.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use VSPE x64 to test serial devices on your 64-bit Windows operating system. We will assume that you have already downloaded and installed VSPE x64 from [Eterlogic website](https://eterlogic.com/Products.VSPE.html). If you have not done so yet, please visit the website and follow the instructions there. You will also need a license key to use VSPE x64 after the 4-week evaluation period. You can order a license key from the same website.
 
## Step 1: Create a pair of virtual serial ports
 
The first step is to create a pair of virtual serial ports that will act as endpoints for the serial communication. A pair device consists of two virtual serial ports that are connected by a virtual null-modem cable. To create a pair device, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch VSPE x64 from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.
2. Click on the "Create new device" button on the toolbar or select "Device -> Create" from the menu.
3. Select "Pair" from the device type list and click "Next".
4. Enter the names of the virtual serial ports that you want to create. For example, you can enter "COM5" and "COM6". You can also use any other names that are not already used by existing serial ports on your system.
5. Click "Finish" to create the pair device.

You should see the pair device listed in the main window of VSPE x64. You can also see the properties of each virtual serial port by right-clicking on it and selecting "Properties". You can change the settings of each port, such as baud rate, parity, flow control, etc., by clicking on the "Settings" tab.
 
## Step 2: Connect one virtual serial port to your application
 
The next step is to connect one of the virtual serial ports that you created in the previous step to your application that you want to test. For example, if you have a terminal emulator application that can send and receive data over serial ports, you can connect it to one of the virtual serial ports. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Launch your terminal emulator application.
2. Select the virtual serial port that you want to use from the list of available ports. For example, if you created a pair device with COM5 and COM6, you can select either one of them.
3. Configure the settings of the port according to your application requirements. For example, if your application expects a baud rate of 9600 bps, parity none, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit, you should set these parameters accordingly.
4. Open the port and start sending or receiving data.

You should see your application communicating with the virtual serial port as if it was a real serial port.
 
## Step 3: Connect another virtual serial port to your device
 
The final step is to connect another virtual serial port that you created in step 1 to your device that you want to test. For example
