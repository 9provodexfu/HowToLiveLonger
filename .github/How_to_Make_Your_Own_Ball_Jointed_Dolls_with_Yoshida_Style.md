Ball jointed dolls have a long and rich history that spans across different cultures and eras. The earliest examples of articulated dolls can be traced back to ancient Egypt and Greece, where they were made of wood or clay and had wire joints. These dolls were used for religious rituals, education, or entertainment purposes. [^4^]
 
The modern era of ball jointed dolls began in Western Europe in the late 19th century, when French and German manufacturers started to produce bisque dolls with ball-and-socket joints made of composition, a mixture of pulp, sawdust, glue, and other materials. These dolls were highly realistic and detailed, and became popular among collectors and children alike. Some of the most famous brands of bisque dolls were Jumeau, Bru, Kestner, and Simon & Halbig.

In the 1930s, a German artist named Hans Bellmer created a series of disturbing and surrealistic dolls with ball joints that he used in his photography and artwork. Bellmer's dolls were influenced by his fascination with anatomy, psychology, and sexuality, and challenged the Nazi ideals of beauty and purity. Bellmer's work inspired many other artists and photographers who used dolls as a medium of expression, such as Cindy Sherman, Laurie Simmons, and Ryo Yoshida. [^1^] [^4^]
